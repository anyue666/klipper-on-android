**Foreword:**

0. Although the steps in this tutorial are as comprehensive and detailed as possible, 
   it is not suitable for complete novice users because it involves basic linux system usage and klipper configuration.

1. The Android system in this tutorial must be rooted. Because the root method of each mobile phone hardware and system is different, 
   there are many tutorials on the Internet, so I won't repeat them here.
